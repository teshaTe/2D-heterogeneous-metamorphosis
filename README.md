This repository presetns an implmemtation of a novel method for morphing between two topologically arbitrary 2D shapes converted to Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) with sophisticated textures (raster colour attributes) using a metamorphosis technique called Space-Time Blending (STB) coupled with Space-Time Transfinite Interpolation (STTI). The method allows for a smooth transition between source and target objects with generating in-between shapes and associated textures without setting any correspondences between boundary points or features.

To build the project the following libraries should be used:

OpenCV: https://opencv.org/

GLM: https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html

OpenMP [optional fot better performance]: https://www.openmp.org/

The presented code is free to use.
