Space-time blending applied to 2D textures

(the original article will be published in SIAM SIIMS journal, the link to the article will be presented later)

This repository presetns an implmemtation of a novel method for morphing between two topologically arbitrary 2D shapes converted to Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) with sophisticated textures (raster colour attributes) using a metamorphosis technique called Space-Time Blending (STB) coupled with Space-Time Transfinite Interpolation (STTI). The method allows for a smooth transition between source and target objects with generating in-between shapes and associated textures without setting any correspondences between boundary points or features.

To build the project the following libraries should be used:

OpenCV: https://opencv.org/

GLM: https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html

OpenMP [optional fot better performance]: https://www.openmp.org/

The presented code is free to use.
