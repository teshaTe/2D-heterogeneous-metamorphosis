Space-time blending applied to 2D textures

The aim of this project is to provide automatically controlled metamorphoses on the basis od space-time blending and space-time transfinite interpolation for 2D shapes.

To build the project the following libraries should be intalled: 

OpenCV: https://opencv.org/

NGL:    https://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/

OpenMP [optional]: https://www.openmp.org/
